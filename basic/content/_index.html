  - conference:
    title: "CONFERENCE"
    body: "Founded in the fall of 2008 by a small group of open-source authors and finance practitioners,
    the inaugural conference took place in April 2009.  Twelve years later we are getting ready for
    the best conference yet - R/Finance 2020.  Over the years we've seen nearly 400 presentations, covering
    nearly all facets of finance, software and statistics.  We've built a reputation as one of the pre-eminent
    networking events for quantitative finance in the world. We've inspired multiple other conferences around the
    world.  Single-track and single-minded - delivering more information and access to our industry's best
    and brightest quants, risk managers, thought leaders, developers and researchers. 
    "
  - community:
    title: "COMMUNITY"
    body: "At the core of R/Finance is a community that is unparalled to this day. World-class authors, practitioners,
    developers - young and old - have gathered in Chicago each Spring to exchange ideas and laughs.  Collaborations
    have been born here that have lasted more than a decade.  New packages, new research, new friendships define
    what is R/Finance.  Ryan, Eddebuettel, Carl, Peterson, Boudt, Ulrich, Pfaff, Zivot, Martin, Basset, ...
    "
  - code:
    title: "CODE"
    body: "The conference is part academic and part practical. Finance is often a rather secretive domain, where the best
    ideas are closely guarded. But around these proprietary methods are industry best practices that benefit from being shared.
    The authors of most of the central packages in R for finance and data are either founders, committee members, speakers
    or attendees each and every year.  Quantmod, RQuantLib, PerformanceAnalytics, xts, zoo, Rcpp, RMetrics, rugarch, urca, vars, highfrequency, ...
    "
  - team:
    title: "TEAM"
    body: "Behind the conference are well known faces and personalities. Creators of things like Rcpp, quantmod, performanceAnalytics, quantstrat,
    Ibrokers, xts, TTR, RQuantLib, Quantile Regression, ...
    "

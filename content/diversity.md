title: "Diversity and Inclusion"

The lack of diversity in tech is well-known, and the situation in quantitative
finance is potentially even worse than in tech. There has been great work on
increasing diversity in the broader R community over the past several years.
We need help from the R community to make the same progress in the quantitative
finance R community.

Other than keynotes, all talks are given by people who respond to the Call for
Presentations. To increase diversity of the presentations and presenters at the
R/Finance conference, the committee asks and encourages members of under-
represented or historically marginalized groups to respond to the Call for
Presentations. Even if you don't consider yourself a member of one of these
groups, you can help by encouraging your peers and colleagues in these groups
to respond to the Call for Presentations.

Speaking at a conference can be intimidating, especially if it's your first
time. You can request your talk be a 5-7 minute "lightning talk" if a full
talk would be uncomfortable. Also, a full paper is not required. We love talks
from practitioners who share their experience solving problems on-the-job. You
don't have to be well-known, or an expert, to provide a valuable contribution.

Travel/accommodation funding is available if that would prevent you from
attending and presenting. The committee can also provide feedback on your
slides, and/or help you practice your presentation.

## Conference

R/Finance was founded in the fall of 2008, by a small group of open-source 
authors, finance practitioners, and academics. Inspired by the annual gatherings 
of finance industry practitioners and academics hosted by the Deithelm Wurts, 
the inaugural R/Finance conference took place in April 2009 at the University 
of Illinois-Chicago.

Attendees have enjoyed roughly 400 presentations, covering nearly all facets of 
finance, software development, and statistical programming with R. Consistent 
and excellent content has earned the conference a reputation as one of the most
top events of the year in both R, quantitative finance, and the fields they 
intersect. 

While some conferences divide attendees and speakers into multiple tracks,
R/Finance has kept the single track presentation model alive and well. With 
presentations from some the most knowledgeable emerging and senior innovators 
in the field, the format means you won't miss any of it!

A leader in hosting high quality, meaningful conferences, the R/Finance model 
has come to inspire other R organizers as well. Today, conferences intersecting 
the R statistical programming language with [medicine](https://r-medicine.com/), 
[insurance](https://insurancedatascience.org/), and others, are succeeding in 
bringing together highly skilled R programmers with experts in their respective 
fields.


## Community

At the core of R/Finance are people. Both the breadth and depth of the 
general community is astounding, and is as unparalleled as the content it 
produces. They include world class authors, industry leaders, students, 
professors, institutional investors, and high performance software developers.  

Each Spring, emerging and senior participants alike, come together to build new 
relationships, deepen old ones, and explore new research. Round tables set in an
expansive conference hall facilitate easy conversations among participants 
originating from nearly every continent on the planet. This is where many open
source collaborations are born, some of which have lasted more than a decade. 
Creating an environment where developers possessing a wide range of skills in R 
and high performance computing can collaborate with domain experts specializing 
in several areas of finance, economics, and business, is what R/Finance strives 
to achieve.


## R Code

Modern approaches to computational finance are secretive, and the best ideas are 
closely guarded. But around these proprietary methods are published works, and 
industry best practices that benefit from being open sourced. This reduces the 
workload of the otherwise siloed researcher working on the similar problems. 
At R/Finance, these are packaged and shared in ways that ultimately add real 
value to the end user, who can refine them for proprietary purposes. This unique 
collaborative environment among conference founders, committee members, 
speakers, and attendees, have produced R packages and code used to manage and 
trade some estimated Trillions of dollars in financial assets. This is the core
of R/Finance.

## Team

Organizing the conference are individuals well known in Quantitative Finance 
and R, volunteering in service to the open source R and open finance 
communities. They have worked as industry practitioners for hedge funds, high 
frequency trading firms, mutual funds, investment consultant firms, the Federal 
Reserve, and have instructed at top universities for analytics and
quantitative finance. See footer links below to find out more about us!

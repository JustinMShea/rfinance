## Conference

Founded in the fall of 2008 by a small group of open-source authors and
finance practitioners, the inaugural conference took place in April 2009.
Twelve years later we are getting ready for the best conference yet--
R/Finance 2020. Over the years we've seen nearly 400 presentations, covering
nearly all facets of finance, software and statistics. We've built a
reputation as one of the pre-eminent networking events for quantitative
finance in the world. We've inspired multiple other conferences around the
world. Single-track and single-minded - delivering more information and
access to our industry's best and brightest quants, risk managers, thought
leaders, developers, and researchers. 

## Community

At the core of R/Finance is a community that is unparalled to this day.
World-class authors, practitioners, developers - young and old - have
gathered in Chicago each Spring to exchange ideas and laughs. Collaborations
have been born here that have lasted more than a decade. New packages, new
research, new friendships define what is R/Finance.

## R Code

The conference is part academic and part practical. Finance is often a rather
secretive domain, where the best ideas are closely guarded. But around these
proprietary methods are industry best practices that benefit from being shared.
The authors of most of the central packages in R for finance and data are
either founders, committee members, speakers or attendees each and every year.

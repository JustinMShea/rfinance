From the inaugural conference in 2009, the annual R/Finance conference in
Chicago has become the primary meeting for academics and practitioners
interested in using R in Finance.

Participants from academia and industry mingle for two days to exchange
ideas about current research, best practices and applications. A single-track
program permits continued focus on a series of refereed submissions. A lively
social program rounds out the event.

We are looking forward to another exciting event in Chicago on June 5-6, 2020.
